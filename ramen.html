        </h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                In medium pot, add chicken stock, water, kombu, soy sauce and mirin.
                Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour. Or until reduced about 25%.
                Set aside and keep warm. This step can be made in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 2 cold eggs carefully into medium pot filled with boiling water.
                Keep water at a low boil to prevent eggs from cracking. Cook for 6 
                minutes and remove eggs and place into ice water to stop cooking.
                Peel eggs while slightly, they can be more difficult to peel when cold.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use leftover boiling water to cook ramen noodles. Follow package
                directions for cooking time.
            </li>
            <li>
                optional toppings such as bok choy split in half, carrot cut into match
                sticks or enoki mushrooms can be cooked in the ramen broth for a few
                minutes to make tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the noodles are cooking, pour ramen broth into big bowls and add hot 
                noodles. It can be simple with just the 6-minute egg and chopped scallions.
                Or add any of the optional garnishes.

        </ol>
