            Ingredients:
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                One 36-ounce porterhouse steak, cut 2 inches thick
            </li>
            <li>
                Kosher salt
            </li>
            <li>
                Freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon unsalted butter
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
            Directions:
        </h1>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Set a rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Season the steak with 1 tablespoon of
                salt and transfer to the rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Let the
                steak come to room temperature 30 minutes before cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Heat a large cast-iron skillet until very hot,
                about 5 minutes. Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season with salt and
                pepper. Cook the steak over moderate heat until browned and crusty, about 3
                minutes. Add the butter, turn the meat and transfer the skillet to the oven.
                Roast until an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers
                120 degrees for medium-rare, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the steak to a work
                surface and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
